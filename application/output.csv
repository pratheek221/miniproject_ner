1,"A 13-year-old male with a history of relapsed biphenotypic ALL, BMT, previous Aspergillus infection of the chest, anaphylactic reaction to liposomal amphotericin B, and peripheral neuropathy associated with voriconazole, developed an invasive fungal infection (recurrent Aspergillus) before a second BMT could be performed. Due to severe diarrhea while on posaconazole oral suspension, he was started on compassionate posaconazole injection (dose and frequency not reported) on 06-Feb-2015. On 13-Feb-2015, the patient was clinically stable with reduced fevers and tolerating posaconazole infusions with no adverse effects. Follow-up information received on 3-Mar-2015 reported the patient died on an unknown date. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.

2,Posaconazole DRT 200 mg PO TID initiated for prophylaxis from 12-Apr-2014 to 16-May-2014. Short-term memory impairment occurred approximately one month after starting posaconazole and resolved after posaconazole discontinuation. Concomitant medications included chemotherapy (AML-BFM 2012 protocol) and teicoplanin.,"[('Drug', 'Posaconazole'), ('ADR', 'DRT'), ('Drug', 'PO TID'), ('Drug', 'posaconazole'), ('ADR', 'AML')]","drt,aml","posaconazole,po tid,posaconazole"
3,"Spontaneous report received on 25-Oct-2016. This case, received from a health professional (nurse) in the, involved a 72-year-old male patient who reportedly experienced lung cancer metastatic while receiving Xyz tablet. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. Current condition included schizophrenia. 11-Nov-2002: The patient initiated Xyz (xyz) (manufacturer unknown) tablet at unknown dos and frequency orally for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Unknown Date: The patient was diagnosed with lung cancer which had metastasized (lung cancer metastatic). It was reported that patient refused to take all forms of medication. Advised patient profile would be discontinued and to inform CPMS if anything changes including treatment plan for cancer. Action taken with Xyz was unknown. The outcome of the event was unknown. Follow up information received on 31-Oct-2016: Updated action taken of Xyz (dose decreased) and added new event (pain) and reporter comment. Unknown Date: The patient had pain.

Outcome of events lung cancer metastatic, neoplasm malignant, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer pain, refusal of examination and lower respiratory tract infection was not recovered and for other events C-reactive protein increased, vitamin D decreased, haemoglobin decreased, neutrophil count increased, lymphocyte count decreased, blood iron decreased, and transferrin decreased was unknown. Company comment: Serious: Lung cancer metastatic (life-threatening), neoplasm malignant (life-threatening), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (life-threatening), cancer pain (life-threatening), refusal of examination (life-threatening) , C-reactive protein increased and vitamin D decreased are unlisted events as per the company RSI of xyz. Causality of these events assessed as possible as contributory role of suspect drug cannot be completely excluded considering the temporal association. Lower respiratory tract infection (life-threatening), haemoglobin decreased (non-serious), neutrophil count increased (non-serious), lymphocyte count decreased (non-serious), blood iron decreased (non-serious), and transferrin decreased (non-serious) are listed events as per the company RSI of xyz. Causality of these events assessed as possible as contributory role of suspect drug cannot be completely excluded considering the temporal association and known safety profile of the drug. ","[('ADR', 'lung cancer metastatic'), ('Drug', 'plan'), ('ADR', 'serum urea'), ('Drug', 'globulin')]","lung cancer metastatic,serum urea","plan,globulin"
